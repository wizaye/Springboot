# Dependency Injection and @Autowired in Spring Boot

## Introduction
This guide covers the concepts of Dependency Injection (DI) and the `@Autowired` annotation in Spring Boot. These are fundamental concepts for building loosely coupled and easily testable applications.

## Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and providing those objects to a class in various ways.

### Types of Dependency Injection
1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
2. **Setter Injection**: Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
3. **Field Injection**: Dependencies are provided directly to fields.

### Example
```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    private final MyRepository myRepository;

    @Autowired
    public MyService(MyRepository myRepository) {
        this.myRepository = myRepository;
    }

    // Other methods
}
```

## @Autowired Annotation
The `@Autowired` annotation is used to automatically inject dependencies. Spring's IoC container will automatically resolve and inject the collaborating beans into your bean.

### Usage
- **Constructor Injection**: Preferred for mandatory dependencies.
- **Setter Injection**: Useful for optional dependencies.
- **Field Injection**: Not recommended due to lack of immutability and testability.

### Example
```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {
    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    // Other methods
}
```

## Conclusion
Understanding Dependency Injection and the `@Autowired` annotation is crucial for developing robust and maintainable Spring Boot applications. These concepts help in creating a clean separation of concerns and promote better testability.
